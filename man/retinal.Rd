  Data on recorded decay of intraocular gas in complex retinal surgeries
}
\description{The study recorded the decay of intraocular gas \eqn{C_3F_8} in complex retinal surgeries 
following initial injection in an ophthalmology study, reported in Meyers \emph{et al.} (1992). The outcome
variable was the percent of gas left in the eye. The gas, with three different concentration levels, 15\%, 
20\% and 25\% was injected into the eye before surgery for 31 patients. They were then followed three to eight
(average of five) times over a three-month period, and the volume of gas in the eye at the follow-up times
were recorded as a percentage of the initial gas volume. The primary interest was to investigate whether 
concentration levels of the gas injected in patients' eyes affect the decay rate of the gas.
